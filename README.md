# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a **machine learning classification model** built using Python to classify **Iris flowers** into different species based on their physical characteristics. The famous **Iris dataset** is used for training and testing the model.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris flower dataset contains measurements of:

- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width  

Using these features, the model classifies flowers into three species:

- Iris-setosa  
- Iris-versicolor  
- Iris-virginica
